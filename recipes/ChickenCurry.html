        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Curry powder - the only spice you need! Any brand is fine here.</li>
            <li>Garlic, ginger and onion - fresh aromatics add a flavour boost that makes all the difference with quick curries! It's the same when making quick Thai Green Curry or Red Curry using store bought paste.</li>
            <li>Chicken broth/stock AND coconut milk - for creaminess and flavour. We're just using 1 cup of coconut milk here - this isn't intended to be an overly rich, heavy coconut sauce.</li>
            <li>Chicken - thighs are best because this curry needs to be simmered for 12 minutes for the flavours to develop. But yes, it can be made with breast - but the steps need tweaking otherwise you'll complain that the chicken is dry!!</li>
            <li>Peas - optional! Try other diced veg!</li>
            <li>Coriander/cilantro - lovely freshness and flavour boost. Coriander haters - use chives or green onions instead.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook garlic, ginger and onion for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and cook until it it changes from pink to white.</li>
            <li>Add curry powder and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk and chicken stock. Stir, lower heat to medium and cook, simmering rapidly, for 10 minutes until sauce reduces and thickens.</li>
            <li>Add peas and salt. Cook for a further 2 minutes, then taste to see if it needs more salt. Garnish with coriander.</li>
            <li>Serve over rice, noodles or mashed potato!</li>
        </ol>
